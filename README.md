# DELI-Dose Sales Application
 
## Introduction

Welcome to the DELI-DOSE Sales Application!
This project seeks to simplify and enhance the ordering process for our unique sandwich shop, DELI-dose.
This app is built to manage sandwich orders, giving customers the freedom to customize their sandwiches with various sizes, 
select their favorite bread, add regular and premium toppings, choose to toast their sandwich, and include drinks and chips in their order.


## Requirements

### Sandwich Ordering Process

- Customers can choose sandwiches in three sizes: 4", 8", and 12".
- Bread options include white, wheat, rye, or wrap.
- Toppings are divided into regular and premium categories, with premium options, including meats and cheeses, acquiring an extra cost.
- Customers have the option to request extra toppings, with premium ones incurring an additional charge.
- Each sandwich can be toasted according to the customer's preference.
- Customers can place orders with one or more sandwiches.
- Orders guide customers to customize each sandwich individually.
- Customers can include drinks and chips in their order.
- The application displays order details, listing sandwiches with toppings and the total cost.
- Completed orders are stored in a receipts folder, each with its file named by date and time.

### Additional Items

- Customers can add drinks and chips to their order.

### Order Confirmation and Receipt

- Customers are guided to personalize each sandwich individually during the ordering process.
- Once the order is finalized, the application presents a summary, showcasing the sandwich choices along with selected toppings. 
- The order confirmation screen indicates the overall cost of the entire order. 
- Successfully placed orders are stored in a designated "receipts" folder. 
- Each order generates a unique receipt file, named according to the date and time of the order.
